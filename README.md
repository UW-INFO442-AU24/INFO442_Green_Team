## Project Overview
Our project focuses on the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11): Sustainable Cities and Communities**, which seeks to make cities and human settlements more inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. We are particularly interested in investigating actions that college students can take to reduce their carbon emissions, particularly those related to transportation. Given that commuting is a major source of emissions, the University of Washington's (UW) initiative to offer reduced parking fees for carpoolers represents an opportunity to promote sustainable commuting. However, despite this incentive, many students face challenges in finding suitable carpool partners. This leads us to our main question: How might we make carpooling and ridesharing more appealing and convenient for UW commuters in order to reduce carbon emissions?
